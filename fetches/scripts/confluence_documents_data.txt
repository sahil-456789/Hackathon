CONTENT:
What is the problem? Reports generated from Workflow Scanner, Assisted Tests and Website Scanner can only be accessed by users who are part of the group. This poses challenges for wider sharing on information and hampers collaboration by hindering sharing with external stakeholders. The external stakeholders can be clients. cross-functional teams such as development team, or leadership. This can potentially delay decision-making and remedial actions based on the insights from the reporting. This also restricts our product&rsquo;s potential for broader adoption and obstructs the seamless flow of essential accessibility info among relevant parties. Who is facing this problem and why do they want a solution? Primarily, QA testers and Product Managers face significant hurdles in sharing accessibility reports within our current system. Their primary goal is to enable broader access, facilitating seamless collaboration with development teams for necessary fixes and ensuring the leadership team, who might lack user accounts, can access essential updates. By overcoming these limitations, the envisioned solution will drive enhanced collaboration, informed decision-making, and prompt actions, fostering a more cohesive approach to resolving accessibility issues and expediting crucial development updates. Why is it worth solving this problem? The following reasons make this a problem worth solving: Improved user experience: Providing a publicly sharable link could significantly enhance the product's usability and convenience for users. Wider Adoption: The introduction of publicly accessible reports could attract new users and increase the product's appeal among existing customers. Customer requests Clients/customers who have requested for Publicly Accessible reports Customer Feedback / Concerns / Questions Link Screenshot / Comments 1 Unknown Share Website scanner reports with team members who do not have access to BrowserStack Link 2 Jet2 Being able to share reports with people who don&rsquo;t have browserstack could be useful. Link 3 Unknown Share reports outside BrowserStack Link 4 Unknown Publicly accessible reports Link 5 Unknown Share results with teams that won't otherwise need a BrowserStack license Link 6 Extron Electronics They don't want to share the reports externally via public link by their users, this should be restricted an option from the admin panel to let them control this. Link How do you measure success? TBD What is the current behaviour? Currently, when a user needs to share Accessibility reports outside their designated BrowserStack group, the typical approach involves exporting the report as a CSV file and sharing it with the necessary stakeholders. However, this exported report, lacks the visualisations and interactive functionalities available within the Accessibility dashboard. This method not only limits the depth of insights but also creates hurdles in effectively communicating the significance of accessibility issues, hindering a comprehensive understanding of the data among the recipients. Also, right now users cannot export the reports from Website scanner. How do other companies solve this problem? Detailed analysis of some tools which have publicly accessible links S No Company - Product Insights Screenshot 1 Amplitude Internal link example: https://app.amplitude.com/analytics/browserstack/chart/pk16s4dt?source=copy+url Management of public links Sample public link: https://app.amplitude.com/analytics/share/1ead30ab585546818d8b285774785eee Last viewed: eg. A few seconds ago Created: eg. 3 minutes ago Delete button Copy link & Share option Share Modal - Option to share internally, copy link or create Public link On clicking on Create Public link: empty state Manage Public links with 2 public links created Success state of Create new public link Revoke access to a public link Share Modal: If active Public links exist Chart accessed through a public link Page when access to public link is revoked Public link settings 2 Siteimprove Can email a dashboard report manually Schedule a report to be sent at a set frequency to a customisable list of receipents. N/A 3 Confluence Watch Video Enable Public link Warning modal Copy public link Have we tried this before? Automate has Public links which enable unauthenticated sharing of a build or session. Behaviour for Automate Public links: The Public link expires with the expiry of a build, that is after 2 months. The customer can request for disabling the Public link feature and any links copied before the feature was disabled will continue working. The public link for an Automate build is encrypted and different on every page refresh as the hash function makes use of the current timestamp. Format: https://automate.browserstack.com/dashboard/v2/public-build/xxxxxxx The public link for a session is not encrypted and does not change. Format: https://automate.browserstack.com/builds/{BUILD_ID}/sessions/{SESSION_ID}?auth_token=AUTH_TOKEN What is the solution? Overview We want to introduce the capability of Public reports which will have a separate link. Publicly accessible reports will enable sharing accessibility insights with external stakeholders via unique, shareable links, fostering collaboration and informed decision-making beyond the user-group. Requirements Feature Flag for Public report links Feature Description Design 1 Feature flag SHIPPED Green The &lsquo;Public link&rsquo; feature should be kept behind a feature flag. Reason: There can be customers who do not want anyone outside their org to see their reports and would also want to prevent their employees from doing the same. By default, the &lsquo;Public link&rsquo; functionality will be available to all the customers. This can be made hidden if a customer explicitly requests for it. If a customer requests for hiding the Public link feature: The Public link toggle will remain off and the feature will be shown as disabled for every report. Info message: TBD If there were any Public links generated before disabling, those should stop working and if a user visits those URLs, an error page should be shown. In a report, when a user clicks on Share, under the Share via public link tab, a message is displayed: Public sharing of reports is disabled for your organisation. Contact your admin to enable public sharing. https://www.figma.com/file/eyGAuacU4wNkhYhGD3pgve/A11y---Local-testing%2C-Sitemap-generation%2C-Publicly-accessible-reports?type=design&node-id=2542-155114&mode=design&t=6c9dpvCxzwDED7Kb-4 Share button: Share via public link (disabled for the org) Share Feature Description Design 1 Manual Test Reports > Share link SHIPPED Green Only the author of a report can enable/disable a public link for a report.

If a user tries to disable the toggle after enabling it A confirmation modal will be shown Title: Are you sure you want to disable public sharing for this report? Description: The current public link will no longer be valid, and signed out users will no longer have access to this report. Buttons: Disable: Disables the public link Cancel: Cancels the disable action Public link, copy button and Manage(if applicable) should be removed. If a user visits the earlier link, the user should be shown an 404 error page and no report content should be shown. The link is removed from the Manage Public links table. If a user re-enables Public link for a report: The newly created link should be different and should not be same as any of the earlier created links for any report. The generated public link should not include the filter values if there were any at the time of enabling the public link. Support for multiple public links: P4 Yellow For a non-author of the report, If public link is disabled for a report, the user will not be able to take any action. A warning message will be shown: Public sharing for this report is currently disabled and needs to be enabled by the report author.

Share Feature Description Design 1 Consolidated Reports > Share Link Allow Public links for only those consolidated reports which constitute the reports authored by the same user who created the consolidated reports. For all other cases, the Public link option should not be enabled and the current behaviour should be followed (Share Link button). For the above case the Share behaviour will be similar to Manual Test Reports When a user attempts to share link for a consolidated report, take input if the user wants to enable public links for individual reports. Also show the current status of public link sharing for the individual reports. Enabled by default c. Feature Description Design 1 Public report - Consolidated Report Suggested URL: http://accessibility.browserstack.com/public-reports/report/xxxxxxxxxxx The public link should be an encrypted URL such that it is not possible to guess the link through the character sequence. Show the following based on: For a logged-in user: Explore Accessibility Testing button. Takes user to Dashboard. For a user who is not logged-in: Sign up and Explore Accessibility Testing button. Takes user to Dashboard. For the consolidated reports where public link enabling is allowed: The Product sidebar and Accessibility Sidebar should not be shown and the content of the report should be aligned to the centre. The page breadcrumbs (eg. All reports > Consolidated Report) should not be shown Individual Report Links: If the user has shared all individual reports: Link to individual reports: If 2 reports are consolidated: The actual name of the 2 reports will be shown. On clicking on a report user will be taken to the public version of the clicked report. If more than 2 reports are consolidated: The actual name of the first 2 reports will be shown.

If the user goes back and disables Public links for one or more reports from which a consolidated report was generated, the public link report should be similar to the case: If the user has not shared all individual reports If the user has not shared all individual reports: Links to individual reports should not be shown. Instead show info message: You do not have access to the individual reports OR the individual links are not publicly shared. Disable Source report(s) and show info message that you do not have access to the individual reports OR the individual links are not publicly shared. Export functionality should be available. Share Link: Allows to copy the public version of current state of report Rest of the content shown in the Public report is exactly similar to how it is shown to a logged in user.
